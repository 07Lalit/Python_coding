              Fundamentals of Programming Language
              ------------------------------------

Q1 What we will study today?
-> What is programming language ? what's the need?.
-> Some Commonly used words in programming lang.
   and their meanings?
-> programming language classification.
->Difference bt/w Compiler and Interpreter.
-> 10 min gd discussion basic
-> 10 min what you should start make your presence
    in the digital world.
-> 10 min revise , hr, homework, reasoning 5 min video.

-------------------------******--------------------------
Low level language->
  It is the most closest language to the hardware.
  fastest (010101)
  machine dependent.

   1) Machine level language ->
            computer's native(jaan-pechan ki)
            ki.(01010)
            machine understandable.
            0 and 1
            fastest language .
            machine dependent
            difficlt to learn and understand.
            Need expert to write and understand.
            error prone(galti hone ke chances
             jayda ho ) language.


   2) Assembly->
   ->modified form of machine level language.
   -> It overcome some drawback that are in e
   earlier programming lang.
   -> Used Mnemonics
    (It is a small english words which represents
     the particular operations).
     ex=>

     add
     sum
     mul
     div/
     easy to understand
     easy to find bugs and errors.
     -> bugs can be defined as the problems that
        we faced in our programs as our program
        not behave the way we want.
     -> errors are of two types syntax errors and
        runtime errors
     -> hard to remember the mnemonics
     -> machine dependent.


high level language ->
       -> It is a English type language.
       -> Machine Independent.

       translator->
       1) compiler
       2) Interpreter

=> compiler
    * Scan whole program at once.
    * Check Syntax error gives all at once.
    * generate intermediate code .
    * consume more memory.
    * fast
    * efficient
    -> c, c++, java



=> Interpreter / Scripting language.
   * Scan whole program line by line.
   * One error at a time.
   * no intermediate code generate.
   * consume less memory
   * slow as compare to compiler
   -> javascript,python,php , perl,pizza ...
