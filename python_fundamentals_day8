
                       Keywords
                       _________

  -> They are the special names , reserved by the programming
     language for specific purpose or different use.

     keywords are used while writing our program.

     Their are 35 keywords in python programming
     -> True , False , None  (this three are onlu keywords which
        start with capital letters ).
     -> and , or , not ,is
     -> if , elif, else
     -> while , break , continue , return ,in ,yield
     -> try, except , finally , raise , assert .
     -> import , from , as , class , def , pass
        global , nonlocal , lambda, del , with


Q If you want to print all the keywords in python ?
-> This below lines of code will print all the keywords in python.
.
    import keyword
    print(keyword.kwlist)
    print(len(keyword.kwlist))
        (['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
35 )

                       comments
                       ---------

  -> Comments are the non-excutable statments of our program
     they are ignored by the compiler .

 Q  How many types of comment's in python?
 -> There are two types of comments in python .
   (i) Single line comment.  ( # )
   (ii) Multilin comment .    ( """  hii
                                     hello  """ )


 Q Why to use Comments ?
 -> 1) To make our code more readable and understandable .
      (because we write code and after some time we forget the logic of it
       and if we use comments in our code we can read it and understand what
       we have done in the each line of code )
    2) Easy to find errors . or we can say easy to debug( to correct errors)

 Q what is single line comments ?
 -> If we want that the compiler ignores this  single line we can use
    single line comment  .
    # is used for single
    after # everything in that line will be commented  .

    ex -:  (single line comment)

     name = "Lalit"    # name is a  string type variable this line is comment
     print(name)      # this is also comment

 Q What is multi-line comment ?
 -> IF we have more than one line that we want to comment so here we will
   use multi-line comment . we can use single line comment also but commenting
   each line is a tedious/boring (thaaku kaam)  task .

   we use triple single quotes or  triple double quotes for multi-line comments
   1) triple single quotes            2) triple double quotes
    ''' hii                             """  hii
        my  name                             we are learing
        is  lalit                            python programming
        gour   '''                          language basics   """

  Note important=> In Object oriented programming (OOPs) we will learn
        this multiline comment is also known with an  special name ( Docs String ).



 Q What are the multiple ways to run python Program ?
 -> So there are many ways to run python program they are as follows-:
  1) By using shell ( given by python )
  2) By Script ( using Notepad)
  3) By Idle   ( given by python when we have installed it).
  4) By IDE (integreated development environment )
     ex-: ( Pycharm , VScode, Atom ..etc )
     popular ide of python is pycharm developed by jetbrains company.
  ..

  Q how to run python in shell ?
  -> So Shell is similar to commad line interface (cmd)   it is given by python
     programming language when we installed it.
  -> We use it to write single line program
  -> It is good for testing purpose.
  -> beginners can use this (for learning )
  -> It work as python assistance .
     you can search meaning of every keyword in python
     just type it's name it will give you everything about it
  -> It has a function called as help()  function which is very useful.
  -> There is a exit() function that is used to exit out from the python shell.

  Why we not use for further programming ?
  -: 1) we can write only single line program in it .
    2) we cannot save our code for later use  we have write new program
        every time .
