                   python Fundamentals
                   ------------------
C -> Procedure oriented programming
C++ =>  Pop and oops
python => pop and oops
java => oops

**********************************************

C -> Denis Ritchie
   * Developed in the year 1972.
   * Middle level language
       -> because it follows some charteristics of
          LLL and some of HLL.
   LLL-> * Machine dependent
         * Can Interact with Hardware.
   HLL-> * User Friendly (English type language)
         * Compiler are used.

   C was used to create such softwares which deal
   with or interact with hardware directly .
   1) Operating System(unix)
   2) Device driver
   * market ki best programming lang. for 10+ years.
(adalovelace First Lady programer ...)

C++ ->
    * Developer name is Bjarne Stroustroup.
    * Developed in the year 1984 .
    * Followed both oops and procedure methodology.
    * application become more secure(reason OOPs).

               PYTHON (Versatile language)
               ------------------------

  -> Python is a general purpose high level
     powerful programming language.

     general purpose-: It can be used in every
                     possible field.
     powerful -:  It is compact with different
                 number of rich libraries for
                 different fields.
         ex-: data science- numpy , pandas
         full stack wed development-: django faramework.


     Libraries -:

     #import calendar
     print(calendar.calendar(2024))

 => Developer of python is Guido Van Rossum.
 -> 1989 me develop kiya tha.
 -> Detuch Scientist work in Netherland
 -> National Institute of Research Neterland.
 -> official D.O.B is 20th feb 1991.

 Ideology of Developing python is ->
 So his Ideology was to develop a language in which
 people don't bother much about the syntax of given
 language but on the logic building.

 Q. Why name python?
 -> At that time they used to watch a famous TV Show
    in their leisure time on BBC (British Broadcast
    channel) named Monty's
    Python flying Circus .
  java ki parent language hai c++

 Q What is the parent language of python?
 -> As python is a versatile language.
   So he takes/inherit best features of different
   programming language.
   1) Procedure Oriented ka feature isne C languge se liya.
   2) OOPs -> C++ se.
   3) Scripting Language -> Perl (Interpreter use hota hai)
   4) Modular programming -> Modula3
   (modules -files) Resuse the same code-Reuseability.
