"""
                     For loop
                     ---------

-> In c,c++,java :
    for(i=0;i<=10;i++){
        printf("hello world");
    }

-> The for loop in python is quite different as compare
   to other programming languages like c,c++,java etc.
-> The type of for loop works / iterate over a collection
   of item (sequence)
   -> String
   -> list
   -> tuple
   -> range
   -> byte
   -> byte array


-> collection of items means any iterable/sequence/collection

  we can use range datatype in python if we know that how many
  times we have to iterate upon a block of code.

  range(start ,ending value,step)

  -> It is a sequece datatype
  -> range() is also a function which is defined inside a
     range class .

 -> range() function generate and return an collection of item .

 -> that's why it is used in for loop .

 range(n)  -> zero to n-1
 range(s,e) -> starting to ending -1
 range(starting ,ending,step)


 Important points-:

 1) Range fucntion always take integer in parmeter.
 2) range(6) -> 0,1,2,3,4,5
 3) range(1,10) -> 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
 4) range(1,10,2) -> 1,3,5,7,9
 5) range(10,1,-1) -> 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

3) It should always be positive when there is one value in range in function .
