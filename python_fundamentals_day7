                        _____________________

  => Identifier is the name of any variable, class , function or a
     module .
     Identifiers are defined by programmers .

     ex->  a = "lalit"  # a  variable is an identifier here.
           import calendar # calendar is an identifier of this module
           class Student   # Student is an identifier of this studendt class
           def fact()      # fact is a identifier def name ke function ko.

     Rule for define Identifier
     -------------------------
     1) Symbol allowed for the name -: A-Z , a-z , 0-9,underscore.
     2) Identifiers never start with digit.
        ex-:  9Num  # wrong
     3) Identifers are case_sensitive.
        x = 100  X=100 ;  both are different.
     4) Reserved words (keywords ) can't be used as identifers.
     5) No Limit for the length of Identifier  in python
     6) Name should be Relatable (good programming practice).
     7) You can use underscore _ also in the starting or anywhere.

     There are three main ways of writing name of an Identifiers.
     ex-:   Pascal case HimanshuGour , AnushkaGour
            Camel case  himanshuGour ,..
            Snake case  himanshu_gour ,...

     IMportant
     ---------

    1) If an identifer of variable start with _ (single underscore)
       protected variable
       _num = 10   # num is a protected type variable .

    2) If an identifier of variable start with __(double underscore)
       Private variable
       __Value = 10  #  Value is a private type of variable.

    3) If an identifier start with double underscore in the
       starting and double underscore in the ending so these
       identifiers has given some special name  known as
       Dunder methods or magic methods

       ex-; __init__  (constructor)  , __del__ , __new__ (oops)

    4) If you write double underscore in the starting and ending
      of any normal variable then it will give you expected outuput
      but it is a bad programming practice so please avoid it..
