                   2)  Script (Notepad)
                   ------------------

 => so there are 3 basic steps to run program in Notepad.
 1) Write Source code in Notepad and save it with extension .py
 2) compile (generate the byte code).
 3) Run/excute .

 => python demo.py  ( I make a file in python)
    this single line will compile our python code as well as run it.

 => Compiler generate byte code file also in this case but the byte
    code is save in the ram and not visible to the programmer .

    so there is a specific command to see the byte code of
    your code in python .

    python -m py_compile demo.py          # python ka code compile hoga

    So this command only compile our code and generate a byte code
    just like java (javac)

    This command just compile our code and then python will not delete
    the byte code file. Now we will get a file with extention
    .pyc  but this file will be stored in seprate folder called
    __pycache__ (dunder method/ magic element)

    dunder -: double underscore

    1) cd java (folder ke andar gaya jha meri pyhton ki file save thi)
    2) python -m py_compile Script.py
       (iss  commmand se python ki compiled file generate hogi
        bo bhi ek seprate folder ke andar)
    3) cd __pycache__
    4) python Scrip.cpython-312.pyc  ( run ho jayega apna code)
