------------------------
1) Programming methodology ->
        It is a way/approch of writing a program .

    i) Pop (Procedure oriented programming.)
    ii) OOps (object oriented programming).

* First programming lang. is Fortran(Formula Translantion).

 1) POP-> fuctions(procedure)
    * It leans towards procedure/funtions .
    * Main foucs is on data varibles , functions,etc.
    * less secure as compare to oops.
    * Not connected to real world concepts.
    * Used in Competitive programming.

 OOPs-:
     1) c++,java,python,javascript....
     2) Simula before c is the first programming
        language that follows oops but people of that
        time rejected it because at that time people
        are not concerned about security because their
        is no personal computer.

     3)Pillars of oops are :
        polymorphism, encapsulation, Inheritence,
        Abstraction.
     4) More Secure -> Specifiers, Abstraction,Encapsulation
     5) Used for development .
     6) leans toward objects.
     7) focus is on class and objects .
     8) Connected to real world.

Q2 Life Cycle of program ?
 Source code(hll) -> compiler ->
 object/machine code/low level language code
 -> O.S(excute/run)->
 i/p->program output.

 1)Source code-: It is a program written
            in high level language(like python,java..).

 2)Compiler -> Compiler translate the high level language
       code low level language code(0101010).

 3)object /machine code=> It is a binary code or machine level
                        code generated by compiler.

 4)compilation -> process of converting high level code
                 in low level code or machine code.

 5) compilation time => total time taken by program
                   to compile.

 6) Exceution time -> total time taken by program to run.
